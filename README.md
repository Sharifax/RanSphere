# RanSphere
Ransphere aims to detect ransomware attacks as they occur by analyzing network traffic in real-time. It employs machine learning techniques and DGA detection to identify suspicious activities and potential ransomware threats.

Key Components:
Network Traffic Analysis:
  Data Collection: Network traffic data is continuously monitored and collected. This includes packet data, flow data, and DNS queries.
  Feature Extraction: Important features are extracted from the raw network traffic data. These features might include the frequency of specific types of traffic, unusual patterns in data transmission, and            anomalies in DNS queries.
Machine Learning (ML) Model:
  Training Phase: The ML model was trained using historical data that includes both benign and malicious network traffic. Various features extracted from the traffic are used to train the model to recognize           normal and abnormal patterns.
  Detection Phase: In real-time operation, the trained ML model analyzes incoming network traffic to identify patterns that deviate from the norm, potentially indicating ransomware activity.
Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) Detection:
  Understanding DGAs: Ransomware often uses DGAs to generate a large number of domain names for command and control (C2) servers. These domains are used to communicate with the ransomware payload.
  Detection: The project includes a DGA detection module that identifies suspicious domain names generated by algorithms. This is done by analyzing DNS query patterns and comparing them to known DGA behaviors.
Workflow:
  Data Gathering: Network traffic is captured in real-time from various points within the network infrastructure.
  Preprocessing: The raw data is preprocessed to extract relevant features that will be used by the ML models and the DGA detection module.
  Real-Time Analysis:
  The ML model continuously analyzes the features of the network traffic.
  The DGA detection module examines DNS queries for suspicious patterns.
